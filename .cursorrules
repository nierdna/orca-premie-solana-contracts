# Solana Development Context
When working with Solana/Anchor code, please reference the best practices and patterns from `solana_program_guide_with_expert_notes.md`.

Key guidelines:
- Follow security checklist in section 12
- Use PDA patterns from section 2  
- Apply performance optimization from section 3
- Follow architecture structure from section 6
- Use proper error handling with Result<()>
- Always validate authorities and account constraints

For code generation, prioritize:
- Security-first approach
- Clear account validation
- Proper constraint usage (#[account(...)])
- Meaningful error messages
- Clean separation of **concerns**
